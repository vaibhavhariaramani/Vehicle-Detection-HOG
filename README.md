# HOG-based linear SVM vehicle detection

The files in this repo form a general framework for training and utilizing a HOG-based linear SVM to detect vehicles (or any other object) in a video. Although I'm not enrolled in the course and have never used Udacity, this project was inspired by the [vehicle detection project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection) from Udacity's self-driving car nanodegree program. I've used Udacity's sample image datasets (which were themselves taken from the [GTI](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html) and [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_tracking.php) datasets) to train the SVM, and the project video provided by Udacity to test my SVM and object detection pipeline.
